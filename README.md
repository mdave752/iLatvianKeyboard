# iLatvianKeyboard
Keyboard layout changes for INT Mac keyboard.


- Latvian Keyboard bundle for Mac with changed INT layout. Keyboard layouts ( **ยง** ) section and ( **#** ) keys are replaced with ( **`** ) backtick and  ( **~** ) tilde keys.   
- ( **ยฃ** ) Pound sign key is replaced with ( **#** ) Number sign key  on **shift+3**.
- Key next to the shift key is a ( **ยง** ) section key for possible configuration input (I use it as tmux command key).

### Usage

- Copy bundle file to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ or ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/  (if saved as curr user, can't be used while logging in.)
- logout/login
