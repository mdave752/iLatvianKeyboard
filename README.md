Keyboard layout changes for INT Mac keyboard.


- Latvian Keyboard bundle for Mac with changed INT layout. Keyboard layouts ( **§** ) section and ( **#** ) keys are replaced with ( **`** ) backtick and  ( **~** ) tilde keys.   
- ( **£** ) Pound sign key is replaced with ( **#** ) Number sign key  on **shift+3**.
- Key next to the shift key is a dead key for possible configuration input (I use it as tmux command key).
